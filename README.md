**GitHub** is a platform for version control and collaborative software development, built on **Git**, a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. It allows developers to host and manage code repositories, track changes, collaborate with others through pull requests, and integrate with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, making it an essential tool for both individual and team-based software projects. 

GitHub also offers features like issue tracking, wikis, and GitHub Actions for automation, which are designed to enhance project management and streamline development workflows. Additionally, it provides a community-driven space for open-source collaboration, where developers can contribute to thousands of public repositories and share their code with others.
